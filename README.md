## Summary

The repository includes the R files and associated images files for the Exploratory Data Analysis course project #1. The image files are in the "figure" folder.



## Instructions for running the R scripts

* Copy the R scripts to a new directory.
* Download the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> datasheet.
* Extract the "household_power_consumption.txt" from the zip file and place it in the same directory where the R scripts reside.
* Open the R Console and change the working directory to the directory where the R scripts and household_power_consumption.txt resides.
* To run the scripts, in R Console: 
**type: Source("plot1.R")
**type: plot1()
** Repeat for plot2, plot3 and plot4.
* The scripts will create (if they do not exist) or overwrite the  image files in the working directory.
